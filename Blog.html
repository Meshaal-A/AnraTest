            <h2>Anura Kumara to ‘Definitely Cancel’ Adani Group’s Energy Project if Elected</h2>
            <p class="post-date">September 16, 2024, 06:23 PM</p>
            <p>The National People’s Power (NPP) on Monday (16) vowed to cancel the Adani Group’s wind power project in Sri Lanka if it gets elected in the presidential election scheduled for the weekend, according to a news report on PTI.</p>
            
            <p>NPP’s presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who spoke during an Indian political chat show, revealed that they would annul the project, as highlighted by the Indian news agency.</p>
            
            <p>When asked if the project posed a threat to the island nation’s energy sector sovereignty, Dissanayake responded: “Yes. We will definitely cancel it as it threatens our energy sovereignty.”</p>
            
            <p>The Adani Group has faced fundamental rights litigation in Sri Lanka’s Supreme Court after it received approval for the proposed construction of a wind power project in the island nation’s northeastern regions of Mannar and Pooneryn.</p>
            
            <p>The conglomerate was set to invest over $440 million in the 20-year agreement for the development of 484 megawatts of wind power in the region.</p>
            
            <p>Petitioners have raised environmental concerns and criticized the lack of transparency in the bidding process that granted Adani Green Energy the go-ahead.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, petitioners have argued that the agreed tariff of $0.0826 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) would be a loss to Sri Lanka and should be lowered to $0.005 per kWh.</p>
